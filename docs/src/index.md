# LeafAreaIndex.jl

The [LeafAreaIndex.jl](https://github.com/ETC-UA/LeafAreaIndex.jl) package offers several methods to work with [hemispherical pictures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemispherical_photography) for the determination of [Leaf Area Index (LAI)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf_area_index).

The ICOS - ETC team at the University of Antwerp provides a free online service with automatic LAI estimation: [https://icos.ua.ac.be/](https://icos.ua.ac.be/)
